# Expected Behavior

The expected behavior of the page is when it's opened up there is a high school button on the top left to take you to the locally saved leader board. On the top right corner there is a timer starting at 60 seconds. In the center of the page there is a paragraph explaining the quiz with a start button below it. 

When the start button is pressed a timer automatically starts and a quiz question populates. When you click an answer you get a response if it's correct or incorrect and are prompted to click next for the next question. The game is considered over when you either finish all 5 questions or the time runs out. When the game is over you are given the option to locally save your score with your initials.

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

# Usage 

The usage of this application is to have a website that shows a multiple choice quiz, but not just any multiple choice quiz. It's a timed quiz that deducts time off your total alotted quiz time for each wrong answer.

To use the quiz you press start on the home page, when start is pressed the timer automatically starts and the answers populate. If a wrong answer is selected you will be told that you're wrong and 10 seconds is automatically deducted. When you finish the 5th question the timer automatically stops and your seconds left is your score which you will be prompted to save with your initials.

# Learnings

This week we learned how to add timers into our code that run the entire time our page is up, how to store data locally on the browser, preventing default in our code and so much more into the depth of what goes into the details of a browser to make it more functional.
